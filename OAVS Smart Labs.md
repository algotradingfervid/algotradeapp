## 5.1 Technical Evaluation Criteria

In order to facilitate the technical proposal evaluation, the technical criteria laid down along with the assigned weights have been presented in subsequent section. The marking scheme presented here is an indication of the relative importance of the evaluation criteria. Bidders securing a minimum of 70% marks in the technical evaluation will only be considered for further financial bid evaluation. Bids or Tenders which do not secure the minimum specified technical score will be considered technically non‐responsive and hence debarred from being considered for financial evaluation.
